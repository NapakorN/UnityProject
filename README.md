What's sup everybody!
This is a simple game we created it's name is "StarGate".
This is about a robot running foward to collect right letters to fill empty slot, which are floating. 
These files you see on github aren't all of game components.
We have uploaded any important components such as scripts, UI-pictures, UI-fonts, and some example scenes.
